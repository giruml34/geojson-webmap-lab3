# Lab 3: Asynchronous GeoJSON Data Loading and Visualization

This lab demonstrates asynchronous data loading and visualization using the Mapbox GL JS library.  
Two GeoJSON datasets are loaded — one representing **points** and another representing **polygons** — and displayed interactively on a map.  
A side panel dynamically lists the feature information and allows the user to **sort** the data by value.  

The purpose of this lab is to learn how to:  
- Load multiple GeoJSON datasets asynchronously using JavaScript.  
- Display data on a Mapbox map.  
- Create a responsive layout where the **side panel hovers over the map**.  
- Hide the panel automatically when the screen width is below 1024px.  
- Implement a **sorting function** for the table data.
